Get_Tweets_By_Subject --> given a set of users, dates, and a query (advanced search), 
			  this module will gather tweets from a specifed user's 
			  timeline within a range of dates. The query is a raw_query term
			  that Twitter's search API can handle. This document requires a user 
			  to  create Get_News_Tweets.py, which contains a...
			  consumer_key
			  consumer_secret
			  API_Token    and...
			  API_SECRET which hold the devs auth tokens
